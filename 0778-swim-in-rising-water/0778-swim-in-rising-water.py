# From Intuition:
# The goal is to reach the bottom-right cell (n-1, n-1) in the minimum "time" t, 
# where "time" is defined as the max height encountered along the path.
# You can only step into a cell if its value is <= t.
# So, we want the path from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) with the minimum maximum height.
#
# This is a classic case for **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
# - Each cell is a node
# - The cost of entering a node is its height (grid value)
# - We're minimizing the "max height" encountered, not the sum of weights
# - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to always expand the lowest available "height" cell

                    nodeNo = grid[nrow][ncol]

                    # Add to heap and mark as visited

                    visited[nrow][ncol] = 1

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Time Complexity: O(n^2 * log(n^2))
# - Each of the n^2 cells can be pushed to the heap at most once.
# - Heap operations take log(n^2) time.

# Space Complexity: O(n^2)
# - Visited matrix: O(n^2)
# - Heap can grow up to O(n^2) elements in the worst case.

# This approach is optimal for this problem and mirrors Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm,
# adapted to minimize the max weight (height) on a path rather than the sum.
