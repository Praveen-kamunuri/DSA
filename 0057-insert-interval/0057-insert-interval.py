# Time Complexity:
# - Traversing the list of intervals: O(n), where `n` is the number of intervals.
# - Adding intervals to the result and merging overlapping intervals are O(n) operations.
# Total: O(n)

# Space Complexity:
# - The space used for the result list: O(n) (in the worst case, all intervals are added to the result).
# Total: O(n)
