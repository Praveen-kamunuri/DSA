\U0001f4cc Algorithm Used: Dijkstra's Algorithm (modified)
--------------------------------------------------
- This problem is a variation of the shortest path problem.
- Instead of minimizing the sum of weights (as in classical Dijkstra),
  here we minimize the **maximum edge weight (effort)** along the path.
- We use a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the cell with the least current effort.
- The 'distance' matrix keeps track of the minimum effort to reach each cell.

\U0001f9ee Time Complexity (TC): O(N * M * log(N * M))
- Each of the N*M cells can be inserted into the heap at most once.
- Heap operations (`heappush` and `heappop`) take O(log N*M) time.

\U0001f4be Space Complexity (SC): O(N * M)
- For the distance matrix and the heap (in worst case).

âœ… Why this works:
- The effort is defined as the **maximum absolute height difference** between adjacent cells along a path.
- Dijkstra's algorithm, modified to use max instead of sum, guarantees the minimum such value.
